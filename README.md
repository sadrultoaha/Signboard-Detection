# Automatic Signboard Detection on SVSO Dataset
By Md. Sadrul Islam Toaha, Sakib Bin Asad, Chowdhury Rafeed Rahman,...

### Introduction
**Automatic** Signboard Detection is based on [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01936.pdf), in this paper we have solved the first step of auto establishment annotation
problem by developing an automatic signboard detection system. While, signboard detection in a developing country is a dificult task due to its challenging urban features. To approach this problem, we introduce a robust model with a new signboard [dataset](https://github.com/sakibuchchash/SVSO-Dataset). The signboard detection model is based on Faster R-CNN architecture including smart proposal box generator algorithm and specialiexed pretrained technique.

This repository contains code for signboard detection model implementation.
