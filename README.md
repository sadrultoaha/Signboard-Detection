## Introduction
<!---**Automatic** Signboard Detection is based on [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01936.pdf), in this paper, we have solved the first step of auto establishment annotation problem by developing an automatic signboard detection system.-->
Automatic **signboard** detection in a developing or less developed city is a difficult task due to its challenging urban features. To approach this problem, we introduce a robust model with a new signboard dataset<!--[dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LQCgF3U-hPL46WLkq1dX8WJzRBSvCGga?usp=sharing)-->. The signboard detection model is based on Faster R-CNN architecture including a smart proposal box generator algorithm and specialized pretrained techniques.

**This repository contains code for signboard detection which will return the segmented region of a signboard with localization details automatically.**

## Guideline for Google Colab Environment

### 1. Installation

#### Clone the repo.

Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), and clone the `Detection.ipynb` file from https://github.com/sadrultoaha/Signboard-Detection.git

#### Install the requirements.
```
%tensorflow_version 1.x
!pip install Keras==2.2.4
```
### 2. Usage.

#### Run the signboard model on SVSO test data
* Set the required path as follows and run all the notebook cells.
```
test_file_path = 'Test'
output_csv = 'output.csv'
output_zip = 'result.zip'
```
#### Run the signboard model on Custom test data
* Upload and connect your custom dataset into Google Colab environment.
* Set the required path as follows and run all the notebook cells.
```
test_file_path = 'your_test_data_path'
output_csv = 'output.csv'
output_zip = 'result.zip'
```

## Guideline for Local Environment

### 1. Installation

#### Clone the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sadrultoaha/Signboard-Detection.git
cd Signboard-Detection
```
#### Install the requirements.
make sure that you have `Tensorflow==1.15.2` and `Keras==2.2.4` installed. (see: [Tensorflow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install))
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Usage.

#### Run the signboard model on SVSO test data
```bash
python detection.py -test_file_path "Test" -output_csv output.csv -output_zip result.zip
```
#### Run the signboard model on Custom test data
To run the signboard model on your desired test data, set the test_file_path to the your own custom test dataset path.
```bash
python detection.py -test_file_path "your_test_data_path" -output_csv output.csv -output_zip result.zip
```

Arguments Details:
* -test_file_path: Path to the testing images folder, i.e., Path to the Public test data or Path to the Custom test data.
* -output_csv: Path to output the predicted localization and classification details.
* -output_zip: Path to output the segmented signboards on input images.
